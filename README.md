🎮 God of War-Inspired Axe Throwing Mechanic in Unity 🎮

I recently developed an engaging axe-throwing and catching mechanic inspired by God of War, utilizing the power of Unity:

🔹 Bézier Curve Implementation: Created a realistic trajectory for the axe using Bézier curves, adding precision and fluidity to its motion.
🔹 Player Movement System: Designed a dynamic scene where players can navigate seamlessly.
🔹 Interactive Controls:

Left Click: Throw the axe with realistic motion and impact.
Right Click: Catch the returning axe, ensuring smooth gameplay dynamics.
This project was a fantastic opportunity to integrate physics, scripting, and user interaction into a polished gaming feature. It showcases my passion for creating immersive game mechanics and attention to detail in gameplay design.
